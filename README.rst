ScribesQuality
=============

This open source project provides a set of quality rules that can be used
in the context of Software Development. By contrast to other projects like
checkstyle, lint, or equivalent tools, the goal is to cover the full software
lifecycle. However you will find here only the *definition* of rules. Many
of them can not be automated. The goal is indeed to support software audit
by providing a reference repository of quality rules.
