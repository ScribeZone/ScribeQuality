ScribeQuality
=============

This open source project provides a set of quality rules that can be used
in the context of Software Development. By contrast to other project like
checkstyle, lint, or equivalent tools, the goal is to cover the full software
lifecycle. However you will find here only the *definition* of rules. Many
of them can not be automated. The goal is indeed to support software audit
by providing a reference.

The set of rules is better viewed on http://scribequality.readthedocs.org
